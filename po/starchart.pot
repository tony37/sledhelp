msgid "StarChart was created by a professional programmer and amateur astronomer who likes to vacation in places far removed from his home town and appreciates the opportunity to view the sky from these places. The XO is a wonderful travel accessory for supporting this sort of thing since it is light, compact and frugal of battery power while providing a reasonably large, reasonably high resolution color display."

It can be used as a guide to the sky overhead, as a tool for planning future observations (including observations from a different location) or as a way to reprise the look of the sky as it was at some time in the past."

So there's a control (actually six of them) that lets you select how dim the stars the activity should bother to plot. StarChart defaults to plotting stars of magnitude 4 or brighter.
