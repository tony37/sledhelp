msgid "The XO laptop has no hard drive and only two internal cables. With care it can be disassembled for repair. For added robustness, the XO's plastic walls are thicker than other laptops. Its green mesh network antennae give a better wireless connection than typical laptops. Plus, they double as external covers for the USB ports, which are protected internally as well. Internal bumpers protect the screen display by cushioning it."
