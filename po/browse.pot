There are so many things on the web that you can use and incorporate in your classroom, but one of the many great ways to start is to help students make sense of where they are in relation to this global context. How far are they from the earthquake's epicenter that rocked Japan? Where is their country's capital? How big is their country compared to others? Where are the historical places in their country and the world that shaped human history and culture? One of the many great tools on the web that can be readily and freely accessed is Google maps (type this on the address bar): http://maps.google.com/"

Example, how far do they travel every day for school (Given that sense of distance, how far and how long will it take to get to the nearest city or town)?"
