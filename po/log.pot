The sub-folders contain backups of older logs (log files in ``.sugar`` are deleted on shutdown).  The second main folder ``/var/log``.  This contains system log files.  These are helpful for troubleshooting issues related to your computer hardware.  The last main folder is ``Other``, and contains miscellaneous log files."

msgid "The ``.sugar`` folder is the first folder you should look at when troubleshooting Sugar and your Activities.  The ``shell.log`` file contains errors, warnings and debugging information for the Sugar Shell.  The Sugar Shell covers the home and neighborhood views, journal, frame, web services and control panel.  Each activity has its own log file, named using its bundle ID. You can find an activity's bundle ID by opening view source while using the activity, clicking the ``activity`` folder and opening the ``activity.info`` file.  If you open an activity for a 2nd time, a separate log file will be created, with ``-2`` added to the end of the file name.  This pattern continues if you run the activity more than 2 times."
