msgid "If you want to write a letter to the editor, you first need to look in the newspaper or on the paper's web site to find their e-mail address for letters. Some newspapers have a policy of publishing all appropriate letters sent to the editor, but most are more selective. All require you to include your complete name, address, and a contact telephone number. You can, however, request that your letter be published with \"name withheld\" if you want. Most editors call you to verify that you really did write the letter before printing it. They also reserve the right to edit your letter to fit the available space on the page."
