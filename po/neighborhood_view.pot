msgid "Access point: WiFi hot spots (Internet access points) appear as circles in the Neighborhood view. If you hover over a circle, the name of the network appears. Each circle has another color inside, the more full the inside color, the better the connection. To connect to a network, click the circle. If the circle shows a lock symbol, expect to enter a key or password. The inside of the circle blinks while your system tries to connect. Once you are connected, an icon for the connection will appear at bottom right of the Frame. To disconnect, hover over the circle, and choose Disconnect on the menu. Or hover over the icon in the Frame, and choose Disconnect there. (OLPC XO-1 Note: The XO-1 laptop has three mesh network channels. By clicking on a mesh icon you join that particular mesh network, and disconnect from an Access point network. The other XO icons are shown will change according to who is on that network.)"
