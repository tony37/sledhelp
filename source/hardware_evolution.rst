Hardware Evolution 2008 - 2012
------------------------------

Although the XO has continued to look pretty much the same on the outside, the electronics inside have been changing. For details of the differences, refer to:

- http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Hardware_specification for the XO 1.0

- http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Hardware_specification_1.5

- http://wiki.laptop.org/go/XO-1.75

- http://wiki.laptop.org/go/XO-4

To some extent, the changes were made to keep using high volume parts, and improve performance. The change from 1.5 to 1.75 involved a change of the processor from x86 to arm, and a reduction in power consumption of about 50%. With power management improvements, this permits the XO to last more than 3.5 hours.

XO-4 is available in two models, XO-4 and XO-4 Touch. XO-4 provides multi touch input on the display.

As you can see from the "boot time" comparison, lower power has not been at the expense of decreased performance.
