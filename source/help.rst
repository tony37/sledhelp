Tour of Help
------------
We see, working clockwise from top left:

1. Activity tab, here you can enter a name for the page or project. The "pencil and book" icon the Description button allows you to add a description to the :doc:`/journal` entry.

  The :doc:`/collaborating`, or sharing, icon is grayed out and not available.

  In Help you do not really need to provide a name for the page you are researching, but it allows you to get back to it easily from the :doc:`/journal`.

2. View toolbar button. The buttons are zoom in, zoom out, and enlarge page to *Full screen*.

3. *Next* button, top right of every page, takes you to the next page of Help.

4. Follow links in the index to jump to that page. Here the Activity FotoToon is being selected.

5. Forward and Back buttons help you navigate.

6. Use this small red icon, only showing when you hover the cursor over it, at the end of a paragraph heading, to place the paragraph well on your screen.

7. Here we see a link to the OLPC getting started page. Within Help you can follow links, which take you onto the internet, when you are online.

8. The Home button brings you back to the index, or contents page.

9. Stop, or close the Activity.

Help read aloud
---------------

In Help, and other text based Activities, you can have robot Alice (the page :doc:`/speak` introduces Alice) read the page aloud in the background, while you explore the Activity. See :ref:`say_selected_text`
