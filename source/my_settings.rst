My Settings
===========

The My Settings page in Sugar is similar to a Control Panel or System Settings window in other operating systems. It provides a way to view or change values needed by system functions, such as the language for menus and messages, the keyboard layout for typing and otherwise controlling the system, date and time values and format, and much more.

To access My Settings, go to the Home view and activate the menu on the central XO icon, either by hovering with the cursor, or by right-clicking (O button on an XO). Then select My Settings. The following view appears.

Click any icon to open the indicated control. If you make changes, the window will offer you the choice whether to save (check mark) or discard (x) those changes. It may be necessary to reboot the computer or restart the Sugar session in order for the changes to take effect.
