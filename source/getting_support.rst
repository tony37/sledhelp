Getting Support
===============

One Laptop per Child is an education project, not a laptop project. With connected laptops, learners are liberated to actively engage with others with similar interests in cultures of learning by doing without being limited by time or space. If you are having hardware or software problems with your XO, remember that its design is to encourage you to learn new things by trying to solve problems on your own!

That said, an entire community built this XO and everything on it, and we want to help you with it. Our OLPC global community of volunteers provide software and hardware troubleshooting and support. This section will help tell you where to find Support when you are really stuck! OLPC has proven that volunteer-driven support works, often with far more heartfelt caring than any corporate help desk!

If you have questions about the XO, ask a teacher for help, a friend, or search on the Internet. If you have a question about your XO, there is a very good chance it is already answered within our expanding Support FAQ / RTFM knowledge base:
