Maintaining your XO
-------------------

Although your XO is tough, try to keep it dry and clean. Here are some tips for taking care of it:

- Carry it carefully to avoid dropping it.
- Don't step on it or sit on it.
- If it gets dirty, wipe it with a damp cloth and dry it.
- Do not dip it into water. If it gets wet, such as from rain, let it dry completely before using it. 

The XO laptop has no hard drive and only two internal cables. With care it can be disassembled for repair. For added robustness, the XO's plastic walls are thicker than other laptops. Its green mesh network antennae give a better wireless connection than typical laptops. Plus, they double as external covers for the USB ports, which are protected internally as well. Internal bumpers protect the screen display by cushioning it.

Sometimes, It happens that the keys you are pressing appear somewhat dark shade of green or somewhat blackish. Remember, don't keep your hand on a single key for long. And wipe it with clean cloth to clean it.

Maintenance of the XO hardware involves updating the software and firmware and keeping the case in working order. Please refer to the Support section below for information on reflashing your XO.
