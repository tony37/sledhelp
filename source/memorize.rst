About
-----

This Activity allows learners to take the learning process in their own hands, as they play but also create their own games. The game has matching pairs of what are clickable tiles, or blocks. The card pairs are composed of text, sound or images. The children turn over the cards to match words, words and sounds, words and pictures, or pictures and sounds. There are a few default games loaded. These images, sounds and text can be extended to animations or movie snippets. Players of Memorize can play together across multiple machines. 

Using Memorize
--------------

Memorize comes with two modes, *Play*, and *Edit game*. In *Edit game* you can make a brand new Memorize game, or edit one of the demo games supplied.

In *Play* mode the Activity has three sets of tiles for demo games, *Numbers, Letters* and *Sounds*. Memorize supports :ref:`Sharing` so you can play the game with others.

The image below shows the Letters demo being selected, and play in progress. Notice that the unturned tiles, are in two sets, tiles are numbered with a 1 in the top part of the gameboard, and with a 2 in the lower half. This is called a *Grouped tile game*.

 (In the Sounds demo, there is an example of an *Ungrouped game*, that is, the tiles are randomly spread over the gameboard.)

The player has already matched two pairs, by clicking on the tiles. Matched tiles are highlighted and a score is shown on the left side. If the pair of tiles do not match, they are flipped back over after a short time, in which you try to memorize them.

When you play a *Grouped tile game*, the prompt will be in the top half of the gameboard, and the answer will be hidden under one of the squares in the bottom half. You have to guess where the matching tile might be. Move the cursor down and notice that the bottom rows are now 'live' --each square is highlighted as you cross it. Select your guess. After you have made a few guesses, you will start to remember where the matching tiles might be.

Creating a Game
---------------
Pressing the *Edit game* button, results in editing the existing game. If you open Memorize from *Resume*, that is, an existing named file, and press the *Edit game* button, you will change that file, and the older file will be overwritten in the
:doc:`/journal`.
In this case the older game is lost.

To create a fresh game, open Memorize, from the Home View, *Start new*. Press the Activity tab. Type in a name for the game.

Memorize will remind you of this difference in behavior. If you rename an existing game, and then press the *Clear all tiles* button, you will be prompted *Do you want to ...* . If you press *Clear*, this will overwrite the previous game in your Journal. (You cannot overwrite a demo game itself. The demo games will always be there if you choose to edit a demo game, and clear its tiles.)

It is good if you have some image files in your Journal, or on a USB stick. If none are available you could make some with Paint, see the tutorial below.

This image shows a game being created. The right side, represents the new contents for the gameboard. So far we have Tux and his image. The left side represents the work space. A picture of a sunset has been selected from the Journal, and the text "Sunset" has been entered into the box marked *Text:*. The cursor has selected *Add new pair*, and when pressed, the new pair will transfer to the gameboard section on the right.

Extending
---------

There is a rich set of opportunities for extending these games. Memorize could be used in history, biology, music, science, early reading, mathematics and others. The media objects available in Sugar, such as sound files and images, as well as all the media objects available by transfer from a USB, or the internet, mean that this game can be powerful in many educational areas.
