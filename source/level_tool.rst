How does Level Tool work
------------------------

Level Tool uses an accelerometer to detect the inclination of your laptop with respect to ground and displays it in a well defined circular grid.

Level Tool can also share with other laptops using collaboration, so that the inclination of a set of laptops can be seen at the same time.
