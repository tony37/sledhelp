About One Laptop per Child
--------------------------

One Laptop per Child (OLPC) is a project started by Nicholas Negroponte at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) with a core of MIT Media Lab personnel. The organization has grown to include passionate people creating software and hardware and sustainable community involvement to fulfill the educational mission of OLPC.

The mission for OLPC is simple yet compelling: To create educational opportunities for the world's poorest children by providing each child with a rugged, low-cost, low-power, connected laptop with content and software designed for collaborative, joyful, and self-empowered learning.

You can learn more about OLPC at http://laptop.org and http://wiki.laptop.org -- everyone is welcome to participate.
