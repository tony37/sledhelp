You can open, flip, and close the XO to position it in different ways.

To flip the XO
--------------

You can switch the XO so that the screen lies flat and covers the keyboard. This lets you handle the gamepad buttons more easily or read electronic books (ebooks), using the arrow buttons to page forward and backward.
