Block Party

Goal
====

Maneuver the falling objects to fall in such a way that they fill a rwo. The rwo will then be deleted. 
Clearing a rwo adds to your score. The game is over when the blocks fill the area and there is no more room for the next block to fall.

By maneuvering the blocks as they fall, you can align them side by side. When blocks fill a row, the row is removed.

As you fill rows, you score points. However, as the game goes on, the level of blocks may rise. When there is no place 
for a new block to enter, the game is over.
